# Workflow Operation

After a workflow is published, the workflow is automatically run according to the scheduling parameters or manually when you perform the pre-running action, you can then view the running status and perform monitoring actions through the workflow operation.

## Key Concepts

### Instance

Once a workflow is triggered manually or automatically according to scheduling parameter, an instance will be generated. An instance represents a snapshot of a workflow being executed at some time. An instance contains task runtime, running status, running log, and other information.

## Major Functions

The workflow operation allows you to do the following things:

- View details about your workflows and perform the workflow monitoring actions such as pre-running, starting, and pausing the workflows.
- View details about instances for each workflow and perform the instance monitoring actions such as re-running and stopping.
- View logs of all instances and troubleshooting information.
