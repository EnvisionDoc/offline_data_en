Using Charts and Controls
===========================

Data Report service provides a rich set of charts for creating reports, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, cross tables, scatter charts, indicating blocks, gauges, and highlight tables, which can satisfy various data visualization requirements.

After choosing to use a chart, select a dataset and the corresponding values for the dimension and measure under the **Data** tab. Then, configure the layout and display of the report under the **Style** tab. Under the **Advanced** tab, configure multi-chart association (if application) to achieve the effect of multi-chart association query.

Besides, Data Report service also provides controls like text box, iFrame, query condition, and image, which can satisfy basic requirements of data analysis and query.
