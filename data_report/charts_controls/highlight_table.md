# Highlight Table

Highlight table consists of row (dimension), column (dimension), and measure. It can be used to view the performance of an index from different dimensions. For example, highlight table can be used to view the average monthly wind speed of each site from the point of site and date. Besides, different sections and colors can be set to show the difference of data size.
