# Best Practices

## Using datasets created by other users in the organization

Users in an organization share a Report DB, that is, data of the organization are accessible to all users in the organization. If you want to use datasets that are created by other users, you can copy the datasets through the **Data** > **Datasets** > **All** page.

Find the dataset to be copied, expand the operation menu, and select **Copy**. You can then edit the copy of the dataset under the **Mine** tab. See the following screen capture.

## Publishing a report public to the organization

When report editing is completed, you can publish the report public to the whole organization or visible to the owner only. After the report is published, a URL is generated for it. With the URL and user account verification, users can view the report online without logging in to the EnOS Console and entering the Data Report service.

If **Organization public** is selected, the report is visible to all users in the organization. If **Only the user** is selected, the published report is visible to the report owner only.

To view a published report, click the report name in the report list. To view reports that are public in the organization, click the **All** tab on the Report page and then click the report name.

You have 2 options to publish a report:

- On the report list page, expand the |dataset_menu_extend| icon for a report draft and select **Publish**.

- On the report editing page, click the **Publish** button on the tool bar.
