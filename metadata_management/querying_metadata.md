# Querying Metadata

Metadata mainly records the definition of the model in the data warehouse and the mapping relationship between the levels. Metadata query provides a unified dataset view, including Hive metadata information, and metadata information corresponding to the dataset of the report library. During development, data developers can centrally view the a table's schema and its attributes through metadata query to assist data development.

## Procedure

1. Click **Metadata Explorer** from the left navigation panel of the EnOS Console.

2. In the navigation tree, browse to the Hive or MySQL table that you want to query and you can view the following information about the table:

    - Path of the table
    - Schema of the table such as the column identifiers, data type of each column, and whether a column is indexed.
    - Properties of the table such as the identifier of the table, when the table is created, and whether the table is compressed.
